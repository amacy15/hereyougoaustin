I added this function above Game-Loop at the bottom

function getStabbed{

    Write-Host "You've won 4 games in a row... you can tell the other players are getting suspicious. 
                Suddenly you feel a sharp pain in your side. You've been stabbed! 
                The last thing you see before it all fades away is a hand grabbing all of your money.
                You knew it was a bad idea to play street dice..."

    $script:money = 0
}


This code was added to the Resolve-Bet function after it increments the win streak.

*******
if($script:winstreak -eq 4)_{
                getStabbed
            }
*******

function Resolve-Bet() {
    # Add or subtract the results of the bet from player money
    switch ($script:result) {
        win {
            $script:winstreak += 1
            if($script:winstreak -eq 4)_{
                getStabbed
            }
            $script:money += $script:bet*2
            Write-Gui "Lucky Winner! You won `$$($script:bet*2)"
            Write-Host "[enter] to continue..."
            $host.ui.ReadLine()    
        }
